      <p>Jessica is a sophomore at the Middlesex County Academy for Allied Health and Biomedical Sciences in Woodbridge, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Jessica's interest in researching female figures in history stems from the noticeable gender disparities present in the fields of medicine and STEM. Her school, where most students want to go into medicine, has a primarily female student body, but she only heard of a couple of influential women in the field. So she joined iFeminist with the intent of learning and sharing the stories of women in science and other disciplines.</p>
      <p>At her high school, Jessica is active in her school's chapter of Junior State of America and on the yearbook staff. Junior State of America is a student-lead, student-run debate and civic engagement club.

      <h3>Student Researcher</h3>
			<p>Louise is French and Russian, but grew up in Brussels, Belgium. She recently graduated with  a Bachelor’s degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences from  the University College Maastricht Netherlands, where she focused on gender, migration and development studies. Now, she is working towards a Master’s degree in International Humanitarian Action. She is a passionate fighter for human rights and devoted to the struggle of gender inequality.</p>
			<p>Her interest in learning more about women in history started when she volunteered for a Nepalese school online and decided to teach about ‘her’ story. She noticed that during high school, the history curriculum was overwhelmingly male centric. Thus, she decided to do some research and told stories, to young students, of different women who all had an important impact on society, but that are often not acknowledged. By researching for iFeminist, Louise is eager to learn more about underrepresented women in history and empower other women.</p>

 <p>In 2000, Claudia L. Gordon took the leap to become the first Deaf Black female lawyer. However, her story started years prior in the rural countryside of Jamaica. Gordon was born on March 31, 1972 in St. Mary, Jamaica. While growing up, she initially had full hearing until she developed a sudden pain in both ears which continued to grow in severity. At only eight years old, Gordon lost her sense of hearing. Although her family sought to find answers, the cause of her hearing loss was never found by local pediatricians.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Gordon was faced with discrimination from a young age in regards to her disability. Being part of  the scarce two percent of her country’s Deaf population, she faced difficulties, such as being ostracized while attempting to fit into her educational school system. Gordon’s mother, her most influential role model, decided to move her to the United States in hopes that she would be met with a greater academic experience. This marked an impactful shift in her upbringing. Although a major change like this can be overwhelming, Gordon stayed fierce by looking up to her mother’s unending determination as a mother, role model, and her fight through cancer later in life. In addition, her mother persisted as a domestic servant to raise a living for her family of three kids. Therefore, Gordon used her spirit as a symbol to stay strong and be the person to get herself to where she aspires to be.</p>
 <p>In the United States, there is a population of over eleven million people in the Deaf community. Upon her immigration, Gordon was sent to Lexington School and Center for the Deaf where she encountered many who shared experiences with her unlike her previous peers. This school, located in New York, enabled her to receive an education in a style suited to her needs for the rest of her educational journey prior to college. After learning American Sign Language, she utilized this as her primary method of communication. Ambitious and hard-working, Gordon excelled in academics and sports alike. Deaf schooling gave Gordon the unique opportunity to learn in an environment surrounded by those who understand her communication struggles and preferences.</p>

 <p>This was especially beneficial for her as her previous mainstream school was plagued with stigmas and discrimination toward those with disabilities. She recognized this mistreatment from a young age and allowed it to spark her passion for advocacy. “These experiences convinced me that I wanted to be a vehicle for change,” said Gordon. By the end of her years at Deaf schooling, she knew that her next step was toward Law school.</p>
 <p>After graduating from high school, Gordon received her undergraduate degree at Howard University in 1995, majoring in Political Science. She then spent her next few years completing an education at American University, primarily focusing on disability rights law and policy. Upon her graduation in 2000, Gordon became the first Deaf alumni of American University Washington College of Law.</p>
 <p>Setting off to make a name for herself in her career, Gordon allowed for the influences of her upbringing to guide her endeavors. With a consistent focus on disability rights, she aimed to ensure equal opportunity for those of different identities. Shortly after graduating law school in 2000, she marked history by becoming the first female Black Deaf attorney. With this tremendous accomplishment, she paved a way for others of her background to take part in such a field despite systemic disadvantages.</p>
 <p>Gordon began her work as the Chief of Staff for the United States Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs in addition to being Associate Director of Public Engagement for the White House Office of Public Engagement during the Obama-Biden administration. Taking action in the federal government gave her the means to maintain the positive impacts of protective laws. With examples of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, these laws preserve rights of individuals with disabilities in the U.S. With nearing thirty years of experience, she has impacted her community through an unwavering motivation: equity.</p>

 <p>Although unmarried, Gordon perpetually gives credit to her mother, shedding light on her continued efforts as a supporter. “Growing up, I witnessed her hard work and sacrifices as she struggled to raise my two siblings and me, all on her own,” Gordon said. Although she recently passed away from ovarian cancer, her memory persists as a pillar in Gordon’s life and the reason for her developed perspective on perseverance. “My mother taught me that we all control our own destiny and should never become victims of our circumstances.”</p>
 <p>On August 2, 2024, Gordon received the Max J. Starkloff Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Council on Independent Living’s annual conference. This was a recognition of her indefatigable efforts toward breaking down the barriers that limit those with disabilities. She, along with the inspiration this award was named after, fights to make spaces more inclusive despite their identities.</p>
 <p>Today, Gordon has continued her influential work in the United States and serves as the chair of the National Council on Disability as well as the Senior Accessibility Strategist with T-Mobile U.S., Incorporated. She continues to represent women of Color as well as people with disabilities. Taking pride in her identity, she stands as a symbol to women reminding them that they deserve to be empowered and accomplish what is beyond the barriers set for them by society. Paying tribute to her mother, she is making her memory proud each and every day she spends fighting for a better tomorrow. Her multiple positions push her to strategize effective methods of promoting inclusivity. “I am motivated by knowing that although progress is being made towards inclusion and access, there is still a great deal more work to be done,” said Gordon, explaining that there are always more efforts to be made to fulfill her end goal of an inclusive and equitable world.</p>

<!-- Reason -->
<h4 class="WC">Why Did I Choose to Research Article Name?</h4>
<p>Representation is vital for any community to thrive. I find it particularly inspiring how Gordon was met with ample success despite discrimination faced for various aspects of her identity. She instead uses these experiences as motivation to do more for her communities. Gordon’s story was introduced to me by my American Sign Language teacher, Mrs. Parker, during Black History Month. This essay is a tribute to her and the value she has instilled in me regarding inclusivity and open-mindedness. Gordon is a clear example of the importance of not allowing ourselves to be limited by the boundaries pushed by small minded people we encounter, and fighting against barriers to open opportunities for those of different struggles.</p>

<div class="Dolatabadi-paragraph">
  <p>Born in 1882 to Khatimah Baygum and well-known religious figure Haj Mizra Hadi Dolatabadi, Sedigheh Dolatabadi was an extremely well-educated woman.  Although she was born in Isfahan, Iran, Dolatabadi began her education in Tehran under Sheikh Mohammad Rafi’a Attari to learn Farsi and Arabic.  Later, she studied at Dar-ol Fonoun Academy and eventually attended Sorbonne University in 1923.  Dolatabadi was educated at a time where it was unprecedented for women to gain an education in Iran. </p>
  <div class="col-lg-6-1">

  </div>
  <p>Before attending Sorbonne University, Dolatabadi was married to much older Dr. Etezad-ol-Hokama at age 20.  They divorced in 1921.  It is believed among persian historians that the large age gap existed because Dolatabadi married this elderly man against her will.
  </p>
  <p>Due to her background in education, Dolatabadi founded the first girls school in Isfahan called, “Maktab-e Shariat” in 1917.  Subsequently, Dolatabadi opened another school for underprivileged girls called “Om-old-Modares.” The opening of these schools had a great impact on women in Iran in terms of increasing the accessibility of education for women.</p>
  <p>Dolatabadi’s claim to fame in Iran was her magazine “Zaban-e-Zanan.”  Dolatabadi expressed her criticisms of the veil, advocacy for women’s education, and exposed the oppression of women experienced in religious circles in the magazine.  The magazine frequently made large political statements including opinions against Iran’s dependency on the western world as well as the purchase of governmental stocks.  Dolatabadi’s statements resulted in an angry mob of men gathering in protest of her speeches.  Dolatabadi was fighting for women’s rights and equality when everyone in her environment was fighting against it.
  </p>
  <p>The magazine only accepted submissions from women and its majority of readers were women.  On January 5, 1921, the prime minister, Sepahdār Aʿẓam Moḥammad-Wali Khan Tonokāboni, banned the magazine due to its critical stance against the Anglo-Persian Agreement.  Twenty-six months after the ban, Dolatabadi reopened the magazine.  Dolatabadi’s magazine is credited as one of the outlets that prepared future Iranian women to take important positions and make women ready to step forward into Iranian society.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, Dolatabadi was well-known for her stance against mandatory wearing of a headscarf.  Not only did Dolatabadi speak out against the wearing of the veil in her magazine, but she was also the first woman to publically abandon the veil even before the legal ban of the veil in 1936.  Dolatabadi famously said, “I will never forgive women who visit my grave veiled.”

  <p>Dolatabadi’s fame was not solely in Iran, she spoke at many international conferences including the International Alliance of Women Conference in 1926.  Dolatabadi’s speech caught the attention of western feminists including Mary Winsor.  In her speech, Dolatabadi informed the audience that the Iranian government was going to make Dolatabadi the inspector of girl’s schools in Tehran.  Dolatabadi created a committee to keep international feminists informed regarding the progress of Iranian women.
  </p>
  <p>After dying of cancer in 1961, Dolatabadi and her father’s gravestone was ruined under the edict of extremist clergymen and islamic vigilantes.  The edict was due to Dolatabadi’s legacy of progressive stances and inspirational speeches.</p>
  <p>Today, Dolatabadi’s legacy lives on.  Feminist activist, Mansoureh Shojaee, established the Sedigheh Dolatabadi Women’s Library in Iran in 2003.  The library was the first professional non-governmental library in Iran.  Additionally, many art galleries highlight Sedigheh Dolatabadi’s bravery and Iranian Feminism, including the International Institute of Social History and the Framer Framed Gallery in Amsterdam.
  </p>
  <p>Dolatabadi inspired a generation of Iranian feminists fighting for women’s rights in authoritarian fanaticism Iran.  </p>

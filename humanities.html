     <h2>Michela Murgia (1972-2023) <a href="humanities.html"><button>Humanities</button></a></h2>
     <h3>Activist, Italian novelist, playwright, and radio personality</h3>
     <p>Michela Murgia was an Italian novelist, playwright, and political activist whose work and life epitomized the struggle for social justice, gender equality, and the rights of marginalized communities. Known for her outspoken criticism of patriarchal structures, Murgia used her voice and writing to challenge societal norms and advocate for progressive change. Her literary works, including the acclaimed novel <i>Accabadora,</i> explored themes of identity, gender, and the human condition, resonating deeply with readers and critics alike. Murgia's activism extended beyond the page as she engaged in public discourse on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, feminism, and anti-fascism. Her influence was felt not only in Italy but internationally, as she became a symbol of courage, intellect, and resistance against oppression.</p>
     <p>Michela Murgia was a deeply spiritual person with a unique relationship to Catholicism. While she often critiqued the institutional Church, she found solace and inspiration in her faith, which influenced much of her literary work. This paradoxical relationship allowed her to engage with complex theological themes in her writing, making her a distinctive voice in contemporary Italian literature.</p>
     <p>‘"Men are also discriminated against" A man can experience personal discrimination for various reasons, but he does not know gender discrimination because no culture has ever persecuted males for being male.’</p>

     <h2>Ana Roque de Duprey (1853 - 1933) <a href="humanities.html"><button>Humanities</button></a></h2>
     <h3>Botanist, Suffragist, Educator, and Scientist</h3>
     <p>Ana Roque de Duprey was the leader of the most impactful women’s suffragist movement in Puerto Rico, known as the Suffragist Social League, successfully earning Puerto Rican women the right to vote. Duprey also created the most comprehensive book on Caribbean botany throughout the entire region, entitled <i>Botanica Antillana</i>. She was extremely smart and particularly gifted in the field of science, where she not only participated in various areas such as astronomy and botany but also taught them to local male and female residents through schools and right out of her own home. Hence, Duprey changed the political and scientific landscape of Puerto Rico for all women.</p>
     <p>Duprey earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Puerto Rico, the same school that she self-founded all women’s college is now under. She was also named president of the Puerto Rican National Library and an honorary member of the Paris Society of Astronomers. Her legacy continues to live on as a nominee for the honoree of the National Women’s History Alliance in 2020. Her incredible work through politics and sciences paved the way for women all across the island.</p>

     <h2>Paz Márquez-Benítez (1894-1983) <a href="humanities.html"><button>Humanities</button></a></h2>
     <h3>Filipino Short-Story Writer and Educator</h3>
     <p>Paz Márquez-Benítez wrote the famous <i>Dead Stars</i> in 1925, which currently still stands as a renowned critical piece for English literature in the Philippines, effectively bringing it to a larger audience and to the mainstream. <i>Dead Stars</i> follows the tale of Alfredo Salaza, a man who finds himself infatuated with a woman named Julia whilst engaged to Esperanza. Additionally, she wrote <i>A Night in the Hills</i> in the same year, to similar acclaim – a story following Gerardo Luna, a jewellery salesman who dreams of a beautiful location in a forest.</p>
     <p>The cultural influence of living in the Philippines during the American colonial period can be found in her work and the activities she participated in during her youth. The previously mentioned Dead Stars is widely considered an allegory for American imperialism due to how its romance reflects the slow decay of Philippine heritage.</p>
     <p>Márquez-Benítez consistently advocated for women in English Literature, even founding multiple women’s colleges and journals throughout her life. These colleges are named Philippine Women’s College and St John’s Academy, founded in the same year as her women’s magazine Women’s Journal which was one of the first of its kind in the Philippines.</p>
     <p>While she has indirectly influenced women through her presence in the field of English Literature, these are just some of the ways she has directly touched the lives of women through education.</p>

     <h3>Pioneering Economist and Expert Advocate for Gender Equality</h3>
     <p>Claudia Goldin is a renowned economist and a trailblazer in the study of gender economics and labor history. She is currently the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University, where she was the first woman to achieve tenure in the economics department. Goldin's seminal work, <i>Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women,</i> has become a cornerstone in the field, providing invaluable insights into the evolving roles and economic participation of women over the past century.</p>
     <p>One of the most interesting aspects of Goldin's career is her ability to combine rigorous economic analysis with a deep historical perspective. Her research has not only illuminated the historical barriers women have faced in the labor market but also highlighted the significant progress made over time. In 2023, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for her comprehensive account of women's earnings and labor market participation through the centuries.</p>
     <p>"Progress for women is not a straight line. It's more like a winding path with many obstacles and occasional breakthroughs, but each step forward builds on the efforts of those who came before." - Claudia Goldin</p>

     <p>Despite being forced into child marriage at the age of 9 and being denied an education for years, Savitribai Phule was one of India’s most prominent social activists for a variety of causes, including education for girls, child marriage, casteism, and violence against women. She started the first school for girls in India and became the country’s first female teacher as well. She brought a change of clothes with her to work every day, as she would be pelted with rocks and dirt on her way to work. She was also forced to leave her family home because her father believed that his daughter was sinning by educating young girls.</p>
     <p>Phule educated more than 150 girls in her community throughout her life, and the schools she founded are still open today. She also created a shelter for pregnant women who were victims of sexual assault.

     <h3>American Writer, Suffragist, and Activist</h3>
     <p>Matilda Joslyn Gage was an American author, suffragist, abolitionist, and Native American advocate. She served as a prominent figure in pioneering a pathway to freedom for women within the 18th century. Having co-founded the National Woman’s Suffrage Association alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she stands at the forefront of helping build a platform for the silenced voices of thousands of women. In addition, she  co-authored 3 volumes of ‘The History of Womens’ Suffrage,’ and even The Declaration of Rights of Women in the United States which helped influence the perspective institutions imposed upon womens’ freedom.</p>
     <p>Despite dedicating her life, and work to fighting for the rights of women and Native Americans, she was written out of history for her radical beliefs that countered the conservative beliefs of the church. Consequently, her recognition failed to deliver in history books. Despite this, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 1995. Her impact is still seen within literature and the foundations that helped pave the path to feminism.</p>

She was also the first Native American and third woman to challenge the Supreme Court, arguing for the protection of her tribe’s sacred Wyandotte (why-un-dot) burial grounds after undergoing forced relocation to Kansas. Many members of the tribe died as they were unequipped for the Kansas landscape, making the cemetery paramount in preserving Wyandotte’s history. Conley also stopped urban renewal among her tribe’s sacred cemetery, creating a meaningful step forward in Native American rights as well as environmental protection. Conley’s advocacy for cemetery protection paved the way for Native Americans and women alike to pursue impactful careers in law, championing the rights of historically marginalized peoples.</p>
        <p>“No lawyer could plead for the grave of my mother as I could, no lawyer could have the heart interest in the case that I have.” - Lyda Conley</p>

The book sold more than half a million copies and quickly made its way to assigned reading lists where thousands of students eagerly consumed its new ideas. Langer was also a professor of philosophy at Connecticut College, before receiving a research grant and going into writing.</p>

      <p>At only 28 years old, Heidy Quah is a prominent figure who has impacted the lives of thousands of people through her creation of the NGO, Refuge for the Refugees. Although Malaysia has allowed refugees to stay in the country temporarily before relocating to another, the country does not endorse the Refugee 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The lack of support from the Malaysian government is due to the Malaysian Immigration Act 155 Law, which makes no distinction between undocumented migrants and refugees. This misgiving creates vulnerability for refugees as they are increasingly prone to arrests and deportations.</p>
      <p>Although society has progressed in many ways, there are still millions of people who seek refuge from their war-ridden countries. As a human rights activist, Quah plays a significant role in aiding victims who need to evacuate the unstable environments of their home countries. Her efforts to provide a safe space to educate refugees greatly impact their lives, since they are often forced out of their homes with no time to collect their personal items or legal documents. This makes it immensely difficult for them to obtain a job or enroll into school to pursue further education.</p>
      <p>Her work is recognized not only by Malaysians but by people across the world. Quah even gained the attention of Queen Elizabeth II, who awarded her the Queen’s Young Leader Award in 2017.</p>

Shafik knew that she was destined for more than what society offered women during her time—she earned a PhD in Paris and became a prolific feminist activist, philosopher, poet, author and editor. She is one of the most influential women in Arab history. Doria Shafik is the youngest Egyptian to have obtained the French Baccalaureate at only 16 years old.</p>
      <p>She started several hunger strikes to demand respect for women’s rights, and to denounce the dictatorial regime of Gamal Abdal Nasser, which banned her from any type of press. As a result of her efforts, Egyptian women were granted the right to vote by the Egyptian constitution.

      <h3>Activist, Feminist, and First Chinese Woman to receive a Ph.D. in the U.S.</h3>
      <p>Mabel Ping-Hua Lee was a significant figure in contributing to women’s rights to vote. At a young age, Lee was involved in activism where she, on horseback, led a women’s suffrage march of 10,000 people. In 1917, Lee led another march, but this time the participants were mostly Chinese women advocating for the right to vote and gender equality. Lee dedicated her life to fighting for women’s suffrage and equality, writing essays, publishing a book, and making speeches.</p>
      <p>Lee, in fact, did not directly benefit from her activism, but her determination and effort made sure other women did. Lee was a Chinese immigrant, and at that time, the Chinese Exclusion Act did not allow Chinese immigrants to become U.S. citizens, prohibiting them from being able to vote. However, this did not deter Lee as she continued to educate herself and her community, becoming the first-ever Chinese woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.</p>

      <p>Alice Schalek was Austria’s first female war correspondent and the only woman in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to be accredited to the Kriegspressequartier (War Press Office) during World War I. Her articles and public lectures on life on the front lines and her travels around the world were both popular and controversial. Schalek gained both acclaim and criticism through her unique style and personal involvement with her work. Schalek observed some of the bloodiest and most futile battles in what was, at the time, by far the most horrendous war the world had ever known. Even though she had no tradition of war reporting to fall back on and struggled to make sense of the genocidal madness she saw, she fought for her place in the male-dominated domain of journalism and photography.</p>
      <p>“It’s strange that fear rises when the [artillery] barrage lets up. To be afraid, you have to have time. When your thoughts are fully occupied fear finds no place to lodge. But when a moment of quiet comes and you don’t know what will happen next, then you often lose your inner composure.

      <p>Actress, model, writer, and part-time funeral parlor worker, Yumi Ishikawa pioneered the #KuToo movement, which was the movement against the discriminatory high heel policy in Japan. It is part of the larger movement about gender equality in the workplace. In many countries around the world, women are required to wear high heels to work. This takes a toll on their physical health, as it is sometimes extremely painful to wear high heels for 5-8 hours straight. After she saw how much other women were also suffering, she collected 150,000 signatures in a petition to let women choose their own footwear in the office and presented it to the Japanese government. Even though she was ultimately unsuccessful, Yumi raised awareness for this issue and effectively shed light on gender discrimination in the corporate world.</p>
      <p>She was included in the BBC’s 100 Women list in 2019 for her efforts and continues to fight against gender inequality in Japan.</p>

Both of her parents died when she was just nine years old, which forced her into an unhappy arranged marriage by her uncle at the age of 13. As a result, she was also barred from going to school. Despite these hardships, Sarabhai traveled to England on her own to pursue an education. There, she found her calling to help others and returned to India to work with disempowered communities.</p>
      <p>Anasuya Sarabhai deserves to be recognized for pioneering the labour movement in India and helping lead the feminist movement there. Unfortunately, she is not widely known or talked about, especially in many western countries.</p>

        <h3>Activist, Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Reformer, and Social Worker</h3>
        <p>Jane Addams was a driving force for the social movements throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>With the help of her friend, Ellen Gates Starr, Addams founded the Hull House─the first settlement house in the United States, in Chicago, Illinois. The purpose of the house was for educated women to share their various areas of knowledge and skills, which varied from educational subjects like art and literature to household skills, such as cooking and cleaning.</p>
        <p>In 1931, Addams was the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is one of history’s quintessential female leaders.</p>
        <p>“Nothing could be worse than the fear that one had given up too soon, and left one unexpended effort that might have saved the world.” -Jane Addams</p>

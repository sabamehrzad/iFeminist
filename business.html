     <h3>Founder & CEO, Innovator, Engineer and Robotictisit</h3>
     <p>Sampriti Bhattacharyya freed herself from the restrictive traditional gender roles in India, rejecting the expectations of becoming a housewife or having a subdued job. Instead, she became an Indian-origin CEO and founder of Navier Boats, a company that creates electrical-flying and sustainable-luxury boats. Her greatest accomplishment at Navier is the creation of an electric hydrofoil boat called the Navier 30 (N30). </p>
     <p>Although Bhattacharyya loved science and math, she failed physics in high school and was not encouraged to further her education. Even when she did decide to enhance her education through internships, she got rejected from more than 500 of them. However, she was so persistent and determined on becoming a scientist that she continued trying, leading her to being the founder and CEO of Navier Boats.</p>
     <p>“If you really want something, go out and get it. Don’t let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do because it is important to know that your work is something you will spend all your life doing…. It will be hard and you might fail many times, but the most important lesson I have learned doing my startup is perseverance.” - Sampriti Bhattacharyya </p>

      <h3>American Entrepreneur</h3>
      <p>Alice Sheets Marriott was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and began attending university at only 16 years old. From there, she caught the eye of J.Willard Marriott, whom she married a day after her graduation. Soon after, they launched a small root beer stand, and though it gradually lost popularity, they quickly adapted to the situation by shifting their business model to a restaurant, using recipes Alice obtained from a chef at the Mexican embassy. Overall, Alice played a significant and active role in their business, taking up tasks such as bookkeeping and making major decisions. Decades later, Marriott International has become one of the biggest hospitality companies in the world.</p>
      <p>In addition, Alice is also praised for her philanthropic spirit, manifested through her numerous posts in institutions. Specifically, she was a member of the JFK Centre for Performing Arts, the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse, and many more charitable organizations. Today, Marriott’s five companies have had over $20B in sales, with Alice’s descendants continuing the Marriott legacy.</p>

      <h3>The First Female Wall Street Broker, “The First Woman on Finance,” First Woman to Hold a Seat on the New York Stock Exchange, and First Female Superintendent of Banking</h3>
      <p>Muriel Siebert was a monumental figure for women interested in finance and opportunities on Wall Street. She began as a researcher on Wall Street in 1954, and from there became a Wall Street power house. In 1967, she was the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. She was the only woman on the exchange where 1,365 men sat for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Muriel faced bias everyday for being a woman and of Jewish heritage. The inequity she faced did not stop her resilience on Wall Street, reaching a position as the Superintendent of Banking in New York. As time progressed, she even ran for the United States Senate.</p>
      <p>She created multiple opportunities for underrepresented people to learn about finance, and in 1994, Muriel was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.</p>

      <h3>CEO of Anti-Poverty Food Bank Trussell Trust & Housing Association Youth Charity Ambition</h3>
      <p>As the CEO of several charitable organizations, Emma Revie has reached over half a million young children, in addition to hundreds of thousands of families across the UK, through her food pantries, housing associations, and community youth clubs. Running the largest food bank in the UK may prove to be a challenge to people such as Revie, but her compassionate and practical approach to the network aims to keep families afloat. In a post-COVID society where the demand for food and services has only increased, Revie has played a heavy hand in aiding families across the UK. While she loves her work in the Trussell Trust, she acknowledges and strongly advocates for a future where food banks are no longer needed, and people like her or her volunteers can build a hunger free future - “a future where people don’t have to come to food banks.” </p>
      <p>“My hope is topped up to the top about people’s willingness to help their neighbors, to see that what they think is right is done, and to step forward.” - Emma Revie</p>

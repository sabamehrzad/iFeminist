 <p>Sabaa Tahir, a Pakistani-American author, has become a significant voice in contemporary young-adult literature. Most well-known for her debut series, An Ember in the Ashes, she is applauded for her skills in creating rich, complex worlds and characters. Her upbringing heavily influences her works, which revolve around themes of cultural and identity conflict, resilience, and hope.</p>
 <p>Sabaa was born in London to Pakistani immigrants on November 7, 1983. Tahir’s parents immigrated to the United States and lived in California’s Mojave Desert, where they managed an 18-room motel. In addition, she grew up with her parents and her two older brothers. Despite the unique circumstances of living in a remote area, her love for books and storytelling was driven by the loneliness she faced growing up in the Mojave Desert. As a child, she used these newly developed hobbies to escape and form new connections. However, her childhood was marked with numerous challenges, as she grew up as a minority in a predominantly white town. This included dealing with threats her family received, probes about her immigrant status, and being treated differently because of her parents’ accents and religious traditions.</p>

<p>         </p>
 <p>In 2007, Sabaa graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a degree in Political Science. After graduating, she worked as an editor for the Washington Post, which helped hone her research and writing skills. In addition, it further exposed her to global injustices, which inspired her to write stories that reflect the struggle of people from marginalized communities. Her debut novel, An Ember in the Ashes, draws on elements of ancient Rome, which wove a tale of oppression and rebellion. The novel landed on the New York Times best-seller list soon after publishing. Her other works include A Torch Against the Night, A Reaper at the Gates, A Sky Beyond the Storm, and All My Rage, which especially draws heavily from her personal history.</p>
 <p>Growing up around two cultures, Tahir struggled with balancing the expectations of her Pakistani lineage and the realities of her American life. This required her to navigate the cultural differences and sometimes deal with prejudices or misunderstandings. Similarly, her struggle with her identity, feeling neither entirely at home in Pakistani nor American cultures, was also prevalent as she grew up. This struggle for belonging influenced her writing, where themes of cultural and identity conflict are prevalent.</p>
 <p>In addition to the internal conflicts, growing up in a family that ran a motel in a desert was not easy financially, as they struggled to make ends meet. These struggles taught her the value of resilience and hard work. Living in a remote location also meant limited educational or extracurricular opportunities, so she sought creative outlets within her limited surroundings. This ultimately fostered her imagination as she turned to books and her creativity, which developed a rich sense of an inner world that would later inform her writing. The isolation of the Mojave Desert also played a crucial role in building her imagination as she crafted several of her stories based around that. This imagination is also reflected in her books through themes of self-motivation and resilience.</p>

 <p>         </p>
 <p>These adversities Tahir faced in her life were reflected in the way she crafted her characters. Her personal history has given her a rich perspective, with a deep sense of empathy, as she portrays her characters facing various forms of struggle and oppression. For example, in her novel, All My Rage, the protagonists, Noor and Sal, are two high school students struggling to balance family, grief, love, life, and a desperate desire to escape their small suffocating town. It explores themes of resilience, cultural and identity conflict, and hope as the characters navigate through their economic hardships and history of abuse.</p>
 <p>Overall, through her books, Tahir has inspired a new generation of readers and writers to explore complex themes and create inclusive narratives. Her contributions to young adult literature went beyond entertainment, offering profound insights into human nature and societal issues. As a strong proponent of the power of sharing diverse personal narratives, Tahir believes that there is a long way to go in terms of creating diversity in publishing. Her most recent work, All My Rage, received several accolades, including the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Printz Medal, and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for Fiction and Poetry. Her nonfiction works have also appeared in The Washington Post, the New York Times, and Vox.</p>
 <p>Tahir now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband and two children. She is awaiting the release of her upcoming fantasy novel, Heir, set in a similar setting to her previous series, Ember in the Ashes. Tahir’s success as an author has inspired aspiring authors from marginalized backgrounds and contributed to a broader cultural shift towards inclusivity in mainstream publishing by breaking away from fantasy novels that Western-centric narratives have often dominated as she introduced elements from various cultures, particularly from Middle East and South Asia.</p>

<!-- Reason -->
<h4 class="WC">Why Did I Choose to Research Sabaa Tahir?</h4>
<p>I chose to research Sabaa Tahir because I had recently read All My Rage and I had never read such a moving book before. It not only got me crying over the plot but it also showed me the harsh realities of financial hardships and child abuse. Tahir’s story was not only inspiring but it also helped me relate to her as another brown girl and really got me interested in wanting to read more books by other female brown authors.</p>

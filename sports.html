     <h3>Syrian former competition swimmer, lifeguard and human rights activist</h3>
     <p>Sara Mardini, born in 1995 in Damascus, Syria, grew up as a competitive swimmer trained by her father. In 2015, when violence from the Syrian Civil War escalated, she and her sister Yusra fled the country, risking their lives to cross the Aegean Sea. When their overcrowded boat began sinking, Sara and Yusra got off the boat and swam for over three hours, guiding and saving everyone on board and reaching the Greek island of Lesbos. Soon, Sara began volunteering for refugees in Lesbos with ERCI (Emergency Rescue Centre International), but her humanitarian work led to a wrongful arrest by Greek authorities in 2018. Despite facing years of legal challenges, she remains a powerful advocate for refugees and was named one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People of 2023. Her story and struggles were brought to the screen in Netflix’s <i>The Swimmers</i> and Prime Video’s  <i>Long Distance Swimmer — Sara Mardini</i>.</p>
     <p>"We were put in prison because we decided to save lives. But guess what? We will not stop!" says the courageous Sara Mardini.</p>

 <p>Edith Cavell was born on December 4, 1865 to her parents Reverend Frederick Cavell and Louisa Sophia Cavell. She was born in Swardeston, England, a town located near Norfolk. As the eldest daughter and first child, Cavell had three younger siblings - Florence Mary, Mary Lilian, and John Frederick - whom she cared for. During her childhood, Cavell’s father was a vicar (a representative or deputy of a bishop) at the local church for 45 years. Although the family was not affluent, they often delivered their own food to hungrier families in their town. Therefore, Cavell took on the generosity that was exemplified in her parents. As a young girl, Cavell and her two sisters would often entertain themselves with crafts and other hobbies. In addition, during this time, Cavell learned French to fluency, which would help her as a nurse in the First Great War. </p>
 <p>Around the age of 15, Cavell decided to pursue an education in the United Kingdom, enrolling in her first school, the Norwich High School for Girls. She later went on to attend three different boarding schools. In 1890, after finishing her education, Cavell traveled to Brussels, Belgium, where she was employed as a governess for the Francois family. She left a lasting impression on the Francois kids through her teaching. Through her role as governess, Cavell learned many skills, such as compassion, empathy, and patient safety, that were later perfected during her nursing career. After five years had passed, Cavell was forced to rush back home to Swardeston, England to care for her father when he fell ill. Fortunately, Cavell aided her father back to health, where she learned her passion for caring for others and nursing. </p>

 <p>Regarding her later family life, there are no published records of her marital status and the number of children she may have had. In pursuit of a formal nursing career, she began training to be a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, located in London, United Kingdom. Her nurse’s training was put to work when the Maidstone Typhoid epidemic, the largest typhoid epidemic that the UK had ever experienced, crippled parts of Kent, England. During this time, Cavell helped a multitude of people through care and treatment. As a result, she was awarded the ‘Maidstone Medal’, an award given to those who were a drastic force in aiding the fight against the deadly typhoid epidemic. Furthermore, she excelled in practicing to be a nurse, even impressing Dr. Antoine Depage, a Belgian surgeon and founder of the Belgian Red Cross. Dr. Depage wanted to expand Belgium’s hospital system; when the Francois family recommended Cavell to Dr. Depage, he was immediately impressed by Cavell’s incredibly advanced nursing skills despite only having trained for one year. He employed Cavell as the head matron (a woman in charge of medical and domestic arrangements in a multitude of medical settings, such as hospitals and clinics) of The Berkendael Medical Institute, a newly established nursing in Brussels. </p>
 <p>Cavell was efficient as the head matron of the school and maintained the institute well. She would also assist nurses in countless other hospitals, clinics and schools, such as the Fountain Fever Hospital and the St. Leonard’s Infirmary. These experiences were extremely important as the First World War began. Additionally, the nursing school became a makeshift hospital for the Red Cross. Cavell ensured that the makeshift hospital provided equitable treatment to civilians and soldiers from both sides of the war, despite Belgium being occupied as German territory. She ensured that no soldier was discriminated against because of the country they were fighting for. </p>

 <p>Cavell also went beyond her role as a nurse; she became a savior to hundreds of downed Allied airmen (such as those from the US, UK, and more) by helping them escape to Holland from German-occupied Belgium, risking both her career and life. Sadly, after 11 months, Cavell’s escape missions were exposed to the Germans by a Belgian spy. Cavell was executed by a German firing squad for assisting over 200 Allied soldiers in escaping German-occupied Belgium during World War One. Moments before her execution, Cavell’s last words were that she “was glad to die for her country.” Despite this being the end of her life, her legacy continued through a goal of hers: to create resting homes for nurses.</p>
 <p>Cavell died on October 12, 1915 in Brussels, Belgium at  50 years old. Cavell’s death was not the end of her legacy. Due to her courage, kindness, and humility, Cavell was remembered as a true hero. After World War I ended, many newspapers raised funds to establish at least six resting homes for nurses all over Europe, fulfilling a goal that Cavell aimed to pursue after her retirement. In addition, Cavell inspired characters in the critically acclaimed novel The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah. Cavell died as a hero and will continue to be remembered as one. </p>

<!-- Reason -->
<h4 class="WC">Why Did I Choose to Research Edith Cavell?</h4>
<p>I chose to research Edith Cavell because I absolutely love the book The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah. After reading this novel, I was intrigued about who the main characters were inspired by. When I learned about Edith Cavell, it amazed me to learn about people who were so incredibly brave and humble and were true heroes. The selflessness of Cavell and her accomplishments continue to inspire me to help everyone that I can and stay true to myself no matter what happens.</p>

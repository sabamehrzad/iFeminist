      <h2>Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951)</h2>
      <h3>Tobacco Farmer and Medical Pioneer</h3>
      <p>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in 1951. She was treated at Johns Hopkins University, where a few cells from her cervix were sampled and given to doctors without her consent. Doctors used Lack's cells in his cancer research in which they discovered that her cells were immortal, meaning they could be kept alive and grow indefinitely.</p>
      <p>For the past 70 years, Lacks’s cells have been used to make huge advancements in science and medicine. However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding her cells due to lack of consent and awareness leading to debates over what rights individuals have in regards to their genetic material and tissue.</p>
      <p>“Henrietta’s were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.” -  Rebecca Skloot, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></p>

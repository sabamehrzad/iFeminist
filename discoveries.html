      <p>Dewi Sartika was a pioneer for women’s education in Indonesia. As a child, Sartika demonstrated a passion for education, yet noticed that girls were scarcely enrolled in school for proper education. In 1904, she victoriously built a school exclusively for teenage girls known originally as <i>Sekolah Istri</i> at the age of 20 years old. The school flourished across the region and inspired women to pursue their dreams, just as Sartika did. After her immense work fighting and advocating for the emancipation of women in 1966, Dewi Sartika was considered a national hero.</p>

      <p>John Keay, the British historian, gave her the title of ‘The Philosopher Queen.’ He said in her praise: ‘Ahilyabai Holkar, the philosopher-queen of Malwa, had evidently been an acute observer of the wider political scene.’ The Queen of Malwa was not only a brave queen and skilled ruler but also a learned politician.</p>
      <p>A year after her father died, she took over the affairs of Holkar fief. She tried to protect her land from plundering invaders and personally led armies into battle.

Tereshkova reported no interest in becoming a cosmonaut prior to her mission, but she was chosen anyway for the Russian space program because of her history as a skydiver. She was one of five out of four hundred female candidates to be chosen to go to space. Tereshkova only went on one spaceflight in her lifetime. However, her spaceflight amassed more space flight hours than the combined hours of American astronauts who had flown before her, and she is the only woman to do a solo space flight. After her cosmonaut career, Tereshkova became a well-known representative of the Soviet Union and became a member of the World Peace Council in 1966.</p>
      <p>Her most impressive award for her flight was the Hero of the Soviet Union medal. Besides being an accomplished astronaut, she has been recognized for her work as an engineer and politician. She currently serves on the Russian State Duma as a deputy chairperson of the Committee on the Federal Structure and Local Government.</p>

      <h3>Activist, Feminist, and First Chinese Woman to receive a Ph.D. in the U.S.</h3>
      <p>Mabel Ping-Hua Lee was a significant figure in contributing to women’s rights to vote. At a young age, Lee was involved in activism where she, on horseback, led a women’s suffrage march of 10,000 people. In 1917, Lee led another march, but this time the participants were mostly Chinese women advocating for the right to vote and gender equality. Lee dedicated her life to fighting for women’s suffrage and equality, writing essays, publishing a book, and making speeches.</p>
      <p>Lee, in fact, did not directly benefit from her activism, but her determination and effort made sure other women did. Lee was a Chinese immigrant, and at that time, the Chinese Exclusion Act did not allow Chinese immigrants to become U.S. citizens, prohibiting them from being able to vote. However, this did not deter Lee as she continued to educate herself and her community, becoming the first-ever Chinese woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.</p>
      <p>“For no nation can ever make real and lasting progress in civilization unless its women are following close to its men if not actually abreast with them.” -Mabel Ping-Hua Lee</p>

      <h3>Austrian Journalist, Photographer, Author, Globetrotter and War Correspondent</h3>
      <p>Alice Schalek was Austria’s first female war correspondent and the only woman in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to be accredited to the Kriegspressequartier (War Press Office) during World War I. Her articles and public lectures on life on the front lines and her travels around the world were both popular and controversial. Schalek gained both acclaim and criticism through her unique style and personal involvement with her work. Schalek observed some of the bloodiest and most futile battles in what was, at the time, by far the most horrendous war the world had ever known. Even though she had no tradition of war reporting to fall back on and struggled to make sense of the genocidal madness she saw, she fought for her place in the male-dominated domain of journalism and photography.</p>
      <p>“It’s strange that fear rises when the [artillery] barrage lets up. To be afraid, you have to have time. When your thoughts are fully occupied fear finds no place to lodge. But when a moment of quiet comes and you don’t know what will happen next, then you often lose your inner composure. Then you start wishing for your own death, just so that the strain on the nerves will end.” -Alice Schalek</p>

      <h3>Japanese Actress, Writer, and Feminist Activist</h3>
      <p>Actress, model, writer, and part-time funeral parlor worker, Yumi Ishikawa pioneered the #KuToo movement, which was the movement against the discriminatory high heel policy in Japan. It is part of the larger movement about gender equality in the workplace. In many countries around the world, women are required to wear high heels to work. This takes a toll on their physical health, as it is sometimes extremely painful to wear high heels for 5-8 hours straight. After she saw how much other women were also suffering, she collected 150,000 signatures in a petition to let women choose their own footwear in the office and presented it to the Japanese government. Even though she was ultimately unsuccessful, Yumi raised awareness for this issue and effectively shed light on gender discrimination in the corporate world.</p>
      <p>She was included in the BBC’s 100 Women list in 2019 for her efforts and continues to fight against gender inequality in Japan.</p>

Chien-Shiung Wu became the first female instructor at Princeton, the first tenured female professor in Columbia University’s physics department, and the first female to win several science awards in her field. Wu spent her later years devoted to programs in the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and the United States to encourage more women to pursue science, technology, engineering, and/or mathematics.</p>

      <p>Anasuya Sarabhai was the first female trade union leader in India as well as the founder of Ahmedabad Textile, the oldest union of Indian textile workers. Although she grew up in a fairly affluent household, she encountered many difficulties in her life. Both of her parents died when she was just nine years old, which forced her into an unhappy arranged marriage by her uncle at the age of 13. As a result, she was also barred from going to school. Despite these hardships, Sarabhai traveled to England on her own to pursue an education. There, she found her calling to help others and returned to India to work with disempowered communities.</p>
      <p>Anasuya Sarabhai deserves to be recognized for pioneering the labour movement in India and helping lead the feminist movement there. Unfortunately, she is not widely known or talked about, especially in many western countries.</p>

Adams, and many female contemporaries, are missing from geographical history and the history of exploration.</p>
      <p>In the early 20th century, Adams figured out what millions of people on social media and crowdsourcing sites still contemplate today: How do you make a living from your adventures? She logged over 100,000 miles—the equivalent of traveling four times around the circumference of the world—all before trans-Atlantic commercial airlines existed. And she was paid for it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never found my sex a hinderment; never faced a difficulty, which a woman, as well as a man, could not surmount; never felt a fear of danger; never lacked courage to protect myself. I’ve been in tight places and have seen harrowing things,” -Harriet Chalmers Adams</p>

      <p>Subcomandante Elisa, born as María Gloria Benavides Guevara, is a Mexican activist and former member of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, or the Zapatistas. As a subcomandante, or sub-commander, she served an important leadership role translating for Catholic peasants and fighting for social change against Mexico’s repressive standards for womxn and indigenous groups. Despite enduring multiple house raids, a wrongful arrest, and state-sponsored torture, she continued to lead the Zapatistas towards a more egalitarian future. She is currently a professor at the Autonomous University of Social Movements, an alternative education program centered around Mexican social movements.</p>
      <p>"In the Zapatista army, men and women get along. There is democracy, there is justice, there is everything there...[W]e live together with men and do the same work.... That is what we are looking for right now. Because as a peasant woman the government does not recognize us. The woman is always down, and the man is always the boss, but right now we see that what the government says is not true. Women can also do the jobs, they can also take charge, they can also lead the same as men, that's why we are fighting so that women also have that opportunity to do those jobs." -Comandista Elisa</p>

      <h3>Chemist and X-Ray Crystallographer</h3>
      <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist who earned her Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Cambridge University. She applied her knowledge of physical chemistry and crystallography to research deciphering the structure of DNA. DNA was known to be a biological molecule at the time, but very little was known about its structure or function.</p>
      <p>Franklin began working as a research associate at King’s College in London in 1951, where she applied her expertise in X-ray crystallography to DNA fibres. Around 1953, she and her graduate student, Raymond Gosling, took a photograph that would irrevocably change the course of history, science, and medicine. Named “Photo 51,” the image clearly showed the helical structure of DNA.</p>
      <p>Most notable for her revolutionary photograph, Rosalind Franklin also made important contributions to the fields of coal research and virology. Her data allowed for James Watson and Francis Crick to better understand the structure of DNA molecules, and in fact, she came to the same conclusions as they did. Her colleague, Maurice Wilkins, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Watson and Crick, however, she had passed away at the time and was never recognized for her work.</p>
      <p>Franklin once said “science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated,” and she lived by that—she worked every day until her death.</p>

      <p>Margaret Thatcher was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was nicknamed the “Iron Lady” because of her uncompromising nature and leadership style. Thatcher was the longest serving prime minister of the 20th century, winning three consecutive terms. Born the daughter of a local businessman in 1925, she went on to study at Oxford where she earned a degree in chemistry, before later qualifying as a barrister and winning a seat in the House of Commons. She then became a part of the shadow cabinet, and was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. She served as leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, and eventually was elected prime minister after an economic and political turmoil led the conservative party to return to power.</p>
      <p>Margaret Thatcher’s policies and political views became known as Thatcherism. Thatcherism advocated for the privatization of nationalized industries and trade union legislation. Even though she was criticized by many for some of her controversial policies, the advancement she made for women is undeniable. Margaret Thatcher held a great deal of power in Britain, breaking countless barriers and proving that one’s sex does not define a leader.</p>

      <p>As a Chinese obstetrician and gynecologist at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Lin Qiaozhi conducted research on numerous neonatal diseases and disorders. Lin became the first woman in China to be appointed director of a hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology. Lin delivered over 50,000 babies in her medical career. She never got married and never had children of her own, but tagged every newborn as “Lin Qiaozhi’s Baby” on their name tags.</p>
      <p>Dr. Lin became well-known and loved by Chinese people, from Premier Zhou Enlai to the local people. In fact, she was called a “living Buddha” by numerous patients, many of whom named their babies for her. After an illness left her bedridden, Lin wanted to create a research center. This proposal was later approved and a research institute was established within the Chinese Academy of Medical Science.</p>

      <h3>Physician and Equity Activist</h3>
      <p>Dr. Susan La Flesche Picotte was the first female Native American to obtain a medical degree. As a young girl, she witnessed a white doctor refusing to treat a sick person due to their Native American ethnicity. This issue motivated her to become the remarkable doctor she was. Dr. Picotte spread her influence upon her tribe on the Omaha Reservation by being the only physician for 1,350 miles and never turning down anyone regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or age.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of her life, in 1913, Dr. Picotte fulfilled her dream of opening her own hospital in the reservation town of Walthill, Nebraska.</p>
      <p>“It was only an Indian and it did not matter. The doctor preferred hunting for prairie chickens rather than visiting poor, suffering humanity.” -Dr. Susan La Flesche Picotte</p>

      <p>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in 1951. She was treated at Johns Hopkins University, where a few cells from her cervix were sampled and given to doctors without her consent.

      <p>For the past 70 years, Lacks’s cells have been used to make huge advancements in science and medicine. However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding her cells due to lack of consent and awareness leading to debates over what rights individuals have in regards to their genetic material and tissue.</p>
      <p>“Henrietta’s were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.” -  Rebecca Skloot, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></p>

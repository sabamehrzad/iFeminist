      <h2>Clara Barton (1821-1912)</h2>
      <h3>Founder of the Red Cross, Nurse, Teacher, Patent Clerk, Women’s Rights Activist, Founder of National First Aid Association</h3>
      <p>In the Civil War, Clara Barton passed through battle lines and distributed supplies, looked for missing people, and helped wounded soldiers. After the Civil War, Barton traveled to Europe where she was introduced to the Red Cross, and founded the United States branch of the organization, where she served as president for 23 years.</p>
      <p>Barton changed how women were able to help in the medical field and was recognized for her efforts by President Abraham Lincoln. She fought hard for women’s suffrage and believed that “the right to her own property, her own children, her own home, her just individual claim before the law, to her freedom of action, to her personal liberty” was important for all women. She delivered speeches educating others on women’s rights and worked alongside female activists.</p>
      <p>“You glorify the women who made their way to the front to reach you in your misery, and nurse you back to life. You called us angels. Who opened the way for women to go and make it possible? … For every woman’s hand that ever cooled your fevered brows, staunched your  bleeding wounds, gave food to your famished bodies, or water to your parching lips, and called back life to your perishing bodies, you should bless God for Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Frances D. Gage and their followers.” - Clara Barton, 1882</p>

      <h2>Gladys West (1930- )</h2>
      <h3>Mathematician, Programmer, and GPS Development Pioneer</h3>
      <p>Gladys West is an American mathematician who performed calculations for U.S. military satellites and programmed a computer to model Earth’s shape with unprecedented precision. Her work for the American government throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s laid the foundation for what eventually became modern Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that is used around the world.</p>
      <p>Born in 1930 in rural Virginia, Gladys West worked hard to pursue an education to leave the sharecropping community where she was born. She earned a scholarship to attend Virginia State University and later worked at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, becoming the second Afrian American woman to ever work there. In 2018 at the age of 87, West was inducted into the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame for her contributions to the invention of GPS.</p>
      <p>“When you’re working every day, you’re not thinking, ‘What impact is this going to have on the world?’ You’re thinking, ‘I’ve got to get this right.’” -Gladys West</p>

      <p>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in 1951. She was treated at Johns Hopkins University, where a few cells from her cervix were sampled and given to doctors without her consent. Doctors used Lack's cells in his cancer research in which they discovered that her cells were immortal, meaning they could be kept alive and grow indefinitely.</p>
      <p>For the past 70 years, Lacks’s cells have been used to make huge advancements in science and medicine. However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding her cells due to lack of consent and awareness leading to debates over what rights individuals have in regards to their genetic material and tissue.</p>
      <p>“Henrietta’s were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.” -  Rebecca Skloot, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></p>

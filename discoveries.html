     <h3>First African-Canadian Woman to be Elected in Canada’s House of Commons, First Black Woman in Cabinet, Former Federal Minister of the Crown, Elementary School Teacher and Principal</h3>
     <p>Jean Augustine, born in Happy Hill, Grenada, is the first African-Canadian woman to be elected to Canada’s House of Commons as a Member of Parliament in 1993. In 2002, Augustine was also appointed as the first Black woman in Cabinet and then the Government of Ontario presented her with the title of the first Fairness Commissioner in 2007. As an immigrant from Grenada, Augustine’s journey from nanny, school teacher, to principal introduced her to activism in women's rights, drug abuse, violence interventions and poverty even before she entered her work in politics. Throughout Augustine’s many careers, she has received numerous achievements and awards, including organizing the first Caribana festival in 1967 in Toronto and being both the founder and national president of the Congress of Black Women of Canada in Toronto. In addition, Augustine established Black History Month in Toronto to be set as February annually and then Black History Month federally across Canada. Some of the various awards Augustine has to her name includes the YWCA Women of Distinction Award, The Pride Newspaper Achievement Award, The Ontario Volunteer Award, and the Kaye Livingstone Award.</p>
     <p>Augustine’s work extends far from just politics as she works to address issues in multiculturalism, women's rights, racism, immigration rights, human rights, discrimination and HIV/AIDS.</p>
     <p>“Have a passion and know what it is. Take a risk. Look for, and find, mentors and role models. Don’t accept mediocrity. Have confidence that you can change the world.” - Jean Augustine</p>

     <p>Eldest in a family of 21 children, Maria Gaetana Agnesi was a child prodigy with a talent for learning languages and applying her linguistic skills to the language of math. Her name would be revered by mathematicians from the 18th to the 20th century for her meaningful contributions to the field of calculus through her thoughts and invention of her witch’s curve, a revered name given to a revolutionary cubic curve she developed.</p>
     <p>Agnesi is known to be one of the fiercest women in the history of mathematics, paving her way through adversities that women in STEM before her had not overcome. Her fighting spirit and innovative brilliance cemented her title as the first woman in math.</p>
     <p>“For it is very well known that persons able and willing to teach it (mathematics) are not found in every city . . . . and every one that would be glad to learn has not the means to travel into distant countries in quest of proper masters.” - Maria Gaetana Agnesi</p>

     <h3>American Writer, Suffragist, and Activist</h3>
     <p>Matilda Joslyn Gage was an American author, suffragist, abolitionist, and Native American advocate. She served as a prominent figure in pioneering a pathway to freedom for women within the 18th century. Having co-founded the National Woman’s Suffrage Association alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she stands at the forefront of helping build a platform for the silenced voices of thousands of women. In addition, she  co-authored 3 volumes of ‘The History of Womens’ Suffrage,’ and even The Declaration of Rights of Women in the United States which helped influence the perspective institutions imposed upon womens’ freedom.</p>
     <p>Despite dedicating her life, and work to fighting for the rights of women and Native Americans, she was written out of history for her radical beliefs that countered the conservative beliefs of the church. Consequently, her recognition failed to deliver in history books. Despite this, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 1995. Her impact is still seen within literature and the foundations that helped pave the path to feminism.</p>

     <p>Charithra Chandran was born in Scotland to Indian immigrant parents, eventually settling in London with her mother. In 2018, she trained at the National Youth Theatre alongside her peers in University. Chandran studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at New College, Oxford graduating in 2019. Some notable characters she has played include Sabina Pleasance in <i>Alex Rider,</i> Edwina Sharma in <i>Bridgerton,</i> and Amelia Brown in <i>How to Date Billy Walsh.</i> Chandran was nominated in the rising star category for her role in <i>Bridgerton</i> by the National Television Awards and Glamour Awards, winning the latter. Combining her acting and advocacy, Chandran has been recognized for her advocacy work in the project ‘She Creates Change,’ an animated series fighting for gender equality.</p>
     <p>Chandran’s budding career was not her initial goal. In fact, she almost pursued a more “practical” career in public policy in her five-year plan after graduating from Oxford. Furthermore, Chandran considered going to law school — even going as far as taking the LSAT. Fortunately, she ultimately decided to share her talents and enter a career in film and voice acting.</p>
     <p>Chandran is set to make her assistant producing debut in the upcoming TV series, <i>Song of the Sun God,</i> a story set during the Sri Lankan civil war.</p>

     <p>Amy Sherald is a contemporary African American painter. Specifically, her works focus on the African American experience and how African Americans appear in American art. She paints her subjects with skin tones in gray scale to contrast the subject’s vibrant clothes and the pastel background; Sherald uses her art to urge her audience to look beyond just the skin tone of a person. As a result, she has continued to be an inspiration and an advocate for the African American community and the injustices they face.</p>
     <p>Sherald is most known for being the artist picked to paint former First Lady Michelle Obama’s official portrait. Sherald was also the first woman to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition for her 2014 painting <i>Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance)</i>. Furthermore, her work has been exhibited across many museums in the United States, including in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>
     <p>“[I want] people to be able to imagine life outside of the circumscribed stereotype, or identity that can be controlled by many circumstances such as your environment, your parents, your friends, your skin color, your class.” - Amy Sherald</p>

      <h3>Italian Astronaut, Engineer, and Pilot</h3>
      <p>Samantha Cristoforetti, a 45-year-old astronaut, though still young, is far more accomplished than countless others in her field, in her country, and on our planet. Samantha Cristoforetti holds the record for the most extended single space mission by a woman (199 days, 16 hours). As of five years ago, she holds the longest continuous spaceflight by a European astronaut. Having studied all around the world and pursued different interests, ranging from mechanical engineering to military and space air flight, Cristoforetti has earned her title as a citizen of the world (and of outer space, of course!) Through her linguistic abilities, unprecedented honors and titles, and especially her determination to push through any endeavor, Cristoforetti has proven that she’s capable of adapting to any job, circumstance, or experience.</p>
      <p>Beyond her impressive accomplishments, Cristoforetti is known for her adventurous spirit and love for storytelling. During her time in space, she has shared her experiences through social media and educational videos, captivating audiences with insights into life aboard the International Space Station. One memorable moment was when she brewed the first espresso in space, demonstrating her passion for coffee and connecting with people back on Earth. This unique blend of science and lifestyle showcases her belief in making space exploration accessible and relatable, inspiring the next generation of astronauts and explorers.</p>
      <p>“When it seems to you that there is no way out, stop, breathe, and change your perspective. A trivial lesson, perhaps, but which I feel I have learned in my bones, not in the intellect.” - Samantha Cristoforetti</p>

She used her recognition in the writing world to further advocate for the acknowledgement and celebration of other female science fiction writers.</p>
      <p>Le Guin used her writing to spread her philosophies of freedom, feminism, and the nuanced conversations that keep people’s minds open to new ideas. Her compiled list of work includes 23 novels, 11 collections of poetry, 12 short story volumes, 13 children’s books, 4 translated works, and 5 essay collections.</p>

      <p>Amaya started dancing at a young age in her hometown in Barcelona, then at prestigious theaters in Spain, and eventually globally as more people recognized her talent and potential as a performer. Furthermore, she was cast in  Hollywood films and musical plays, such as <i>María de la O</i>.

She was also the first Native American and third woman to challenge the Supreme Court, arguing for the protection of her tribe’s sacred Wyandotte (why-un-dot) burial grounds after undergoing forced relocation to Kansas. Many members of the tribe died as they were unequipped for the Kansas landscape, making the cemetery paramount in preserving Wyandotte’s history. Conley also stopped urban renewal among her tribe’s sacred cemetery, creating a meaningful step forward in Native American rights as well as environmental protection.

      <p>At only 28 years old, Heidy Quah is a prominent figure who has impacted the lives of thousands of people through her creation of the NGO, Refuge for the Refugees. Although Malaysia has allowed refugees to stay in the country temporarily before relocating to another, the country does not endorse the Refugee 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The lack of support from the Malaysian government is due to the Malaysian Immigration Act 155 Law, which makes no distinction between undocumented migrants and refugees. This misgiving creates vulnerability for refugees as they are increasingly prone to arrests and deportations.</p>
      <p>Although society has progressed in many ways, there are still millions of people who seek refuge from their war-ridden countries. As a human rights activist, Quah plays a significant role in aiding victims who need to evacuate the unstable environments of their home countries. Her efforts to provide a safe space to educate refugees greatly impact their lives, since they are often forced out of their homes with no time to collect their personal items or legal documents. This makes it immensely difficult for them to obtain a job or enroll into school to pursue further education.</p>
      <p>Her work is recognized not only by Malaysians but by people across the world. Quah even gained the attention of Queen Elizabeth II, who awarded her the Queen’s Young Leader Award in 2017.</p>

      <h3>American Espionage Agent</h3>
      <p>Virginia Hall was one of the first women to be an espionage agent. Although she lived in a time dominated by traditional values, where society taught her to believe that women should only focus on marriage, Hall was able to break the barriers that had been set for her. She chose to pursue higher education at one of the most prestigious women’s colleges, Barnard College, dreaming of becoming a diplomat.</p>
      <p>Even though Hall could no longer pursue that career due to the amputation of her left leg, she did not let that dictate her life. After impressing an SOE (Special Operations Executive) agent, she was hired to work for Britain’s World War II Espionage Organization. Through her wit and bravery, Hall provided the Allies valuable information, plotted safe areas, and completed other critical missions. Two years later, she joined the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), an American spy organization, where she provided equally important information and fulfilled other dangerous missions.</p>
      <p>She has received many awards from France, Britain, and the USA for her service. Virginia was the only woman to be given an award in World War II from the American government. After her eventful spy career, she and her husband worked office jobs at the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) for 15 years before they retired. Hall preferred to remain unrecognized throughout the rest of her life to stay safe and undisturbed.</p>

      <p>Yu Gwansun, referred to as Korea’s “Joan of Arc,” was a fearless young woman who showcased great bravery and patriotism for the freedom of her country. She is best known for joining the March 1st (“Samil” translating to “three-one” or “March-one”) Movement, a collection of protests fighting for Korea’s independence from Japanese control since the peninsula went under colonial rule in 1905. Yu has displayed not only her impeccable strength, but also great adoration for her country through her willingness to endanger her own life to lead and advocate protests. Through these demonstrations, Yu would witness the murder of both her parents, peers, and imprisonments, which were generated by colonial authority.</p>
      <p>Even in prison, her activism persisted by holding protests by herself or with fellow prisoners. Yu died in 1920 at the age of 17 due to starvation and torture. Although she was never given the chance to embrace a free Korea as she died long before its liberation in 1945, she remains as a great source of inspiration to Koreans to this day.</p>

Since they had limited opportunities for health care, occupations, and education, Filosofova wanted all women to live the life they deserved.</p>
      <p>Throughout her life, Filosofova stood out as a bold woman whose actions toward “improving the situation of women in Russia” seemed to be misunderstood by the Russian authorities (Eidelman, 2007). Until her death, she continued advocating for women’s rights in Russia, yet the authorities always seemed to view her actions under suspicion. Nevertheless, Filosofova accomplished many feats, including founding the Society for Inexpensive Apartments for Working Women and the Society for Providing the Means for Women's Higher Education as well as providing jobs to many Russian women. Although she was heavily misunderstood throughout her life, Filosofova’s actions remain the blueprint for many pre-revolutionary feminist efforts.</p>

      <p>Despite the term “feminism” not arising until the late 1800s, Mary Shelley’s trailblazing literary achievements demonstrate essential feminist virtues.</p>
      <p>Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (Shelley) was born on August 30th, 1797. Daughter of women’s rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft and philosopher William Godwin, Shelley grew up surrounded by literature.</p>
      <p>Shelley devoted her life to writing and producing many publications of various genres and styles. However, her most distinguished novel is <i>Frankenstein</i>, which is one of the more well-known classics, with its modern themes of scientific exploitation and alienation. Arguably, the novel is one of the first examples of science fiction, a widely developed genre that is loved to this day. Despite the success of her novel, she faced immense criticism for being a female author while also coping with the loss of many family members. Furthermore, Mary’s story is inspiring because despite living in a male-dominated time, Mary used her writing talent to support herself and her child financially. The legacy of Shelley’s <i>Frankenstein</i> continues to be studied and analyzed globally.</p>

      <h3>Italian Baroque Painter</h3>
      <p>In addition to her womanhood, Artemisia Gentileschi’s artistic expertise pushed barriers for canonical status in art and forever altered who could be deemed “a great artist.” As one of the few women of her time to achieve a successful career as an artist, Gentileschi resisted representations of women that catered to their (women’s) subjection by, instead, asserting their (women’s) multidimensionality.</p>
      <p>Despite achieving success and notoriety in her lifetime, Gentileschi’s artwork lost much of its relevance within the historical canon of western art, until it was given new life by feminist art historians. The impetus behind much of Gentileschi’s contemporary relevance is the amplified conversation of women’s oppression and sexual abuse of women, which are two themes found in Gentileschi’s life story and artwork. Her artwork remains a stimulus for conversations of women’s status in the world of art, as well as in the world at large.</p>

      <p>Despite her fame, Maria Anna’s musical tours ended when she was eighteen, due to European expectations for women and reputation ideals. She was forced to settle down and marry, but continued independently pursuing her passion for music. She took on many students and even composed music.

Even though societal norms held her back from her passions, she continued to make music throughout her life.

      <p>Rosa Bonheur was a French artist, born in 1822. As a painter and sculptor renowned for accuracy and detail in her works, Bonheur was the first female recipient of France’s highest honor: the Grand Cross.</p>
      <p><i>The Horse Fair</i> (1853), her masterpiece and most famous work, was acquired by Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1887. He later donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it can be found today. Beyond her artistic abilities, Bonheur was known for her trailblazing style of dress and romantic partners. She painted animals and farm or fair scenes, typically in dirty areas where lots of physical activity was required. In order for Bonheur to move freely without the burden of petticoats, the government allowed her to dress like a man, with a smock and trousers (otherwise forbidden to women). The juxtaposition of her femininity and her masculine style of dress has been cited as helping to shape the androgynous style of dress of the early 20th century. She also had two long-term female companions; in fact, she forced a change in the Napoleonic Code to legally transfer her estate to her romantic partner and fellow painter Anna Klumpke. Even after her death in 1899, she continued to serve as a role model for future female artists, LGBTQ+ luminaries, and feminists. </p>
      <p>“Why shouldn’t I be proud to be a woman? My father, that enthusiastic apostle of humanity, told me again and again that it was woman’s mission to improve the human race…To his doctrines I owe my great and glorious ambition for the sex to which I proudly belong, whose independence I’ll defend till my dying day.

      <h3>First Female Video Game Designer, Co-Creator of the First Educational Video Game, and Teacher</h3>
      <p>Mabel Addis Mergardt was an extremely influential game designer and teacher. In 1962, Mergardt worked with the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) and IBM to create the first educational video game. She worked on the game for five years with William McKay, an IBM programmer, overseeing its storyline and progression.</p>
      <p>The result of their efforts was the Sumerian Game, a text-based video game. The Sumerian Game made strides not only as the first educational video game but also as one of the first narrative-based video games. The Sumerian Game showed that a well-designed video game could be fun for people of all ages and inspired multiple other text-based video games, each influential in their own right, such as the Oregon Trail in 1971 and Hammurabi in 1978.</p>

      <p>Lady Diana Frances Spencer, famously known as “The People’s Princess,” served as a member of the British Royal Family and is remembered for her charitable work on behalf of the British commonwealth. Her generosity, sympathy, and liberality gave strength to those who needed it most, fueling progressive change against long standing royal traditions. Princess Diana was a pioneer for humanitarian efforts, proving to be more than a high profile royal, and dedicated to  destigmatizing the emerging AIDS/HIV virus in the 1980s, by interacting with ill patients, funding and working for homeless shelters, helping to ban landmines, visiting hospitals to raise awareness, and working alongside deaf or impoverished children. By breaking the expectations and constraints of royal culture, “The People’s Princess” was able to cement her compassion into the hearts of a global network of admirers.</p>
      <p>On June 14th, 1999, Time Magazine listed Princess Diana in its “Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century,” under the category “hero and icon.”</p>
      <p>“Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.” - Princess Diana</p>

      <p>Dewi Sartika was a pioneer for women’s education in Indonesia. As a child, Sartika demonstrated a passion for education, yet noticed that girls were scarcely enrolled in school for proper education. In 1904, she victoriously built a school exclusively for teenage girls known originally as <i>Sekolah Istri</i> at the age of 20 years old. The school flourished across the region and inspired women to pursue their dreams, just as Sartika did. After her immense work fighting and advocating for the emancipation of women in 1966, Dewi Sartika was considered a national hero.</p>

Tereshkova reported no interest in becoming a cosmonaut prior to her mission, but she was chosen anyway for the Russian space program because of her history as a skydiver. She was one of five out of four hundred female candidates to be chosen to go to space. Tereshkova only went on one spaceflight in her lifetime. However, her spaceflight amassed more space flight hours than the combined hours of American astronauts who had flown before her, and she is the only woman to do a solo space flight. After her cosmonaut career, Tereshkova became a well-known representative of the Soviet Union and became a member of the World Peace Council in 1966.</p>
      <p>Her most impressive award for her flight was the Hero of the Soviet Union medal. Besides being an accomplished astronaut, she has been recognized for her work as an engineer and politician.

      <h3>Activist, Feminist, and First Chinese Woman to receive a Ph.D. in the U.S.</h3>
      <p>Mabel Ping-Hua Lee was a significant figure in contributing to women’s rights to vote. At a young age, Lee was involved in activism where she, on horseback, led a women’s suffrage march of 10,000 people. In 1917, Lee led another march, but this time the participants were mostly Chinese women advocating for the right to vote and gender equality. Lee dedicated her life to fighting for women’s suffrage and equality, writing essays, publishing a book, and making speeches.</p>
      <p>Lee, in fact, did not directly benefit from her activism, but her determination and effort made sure other women did. Lee was a Chinese immigrant, and at that time, the Chinese Exclusion Act did not allow Chinese immigrants to become U.S. citizens, prohibiting them from being able to vote. However, this did not deter Lee as she continued to educate herself and her community, becoming the first-ever Chinese woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.</p>

      <p>Alice Schalek was Austria’s first female war correspondent and the only woman in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to be accredited to the Kriegspressequartier (War Press Office) during World War I. Her articles and public lectures on life on the front lines and her travels around the world were both popular and controversial. Schalek gained both acclaim and criticism through her unique style and personal involvement with her work. Schalek observed some of the bloodiest and most futile battles in what was, at the time, by far the most horrendous war the world had ever known. Even though she had no tradition of war reporting to fall back on and struggled to make sense of the genocidal madness she saw, she fought for her place in the male-dominated domain of journalism and photography.</p>

      <p>Actress, model, writer, and part-time funeral parlor worker, Yumi Ishikawa pioneered the #KuToo movement, which was the movement against the discriminatory high heel policy in Japan. It is part of the larger movement about gender equality in the workplace. In many countries around the world, women are required to wear high heels to work. This takes a toll on their physical health, as it is sometimes extremely painful to wear high heels for 5-8 hours straight. After she saw how much other women were also suffering, she collected 150,000 signatures in a petition to let women choose their own footwear in the office and presented it to the Japanese government. Even though she was ultimately unsuccessful, Yumi raised awareness for this issue and effectively shed light on gender discrimination in the corporate world.</p>
      <p>She was included in the BBC’s 100 Women list in 2019 for her efforts and continues to fight against gender inequality in Japan.</p>

      <h3>Chemist and X-Ray Crystallographer</h3>
      <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist who earned her Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Cambridge University. She applied her knowledge of physical chemistry and crystallography to research deciphering the structure of DNA. DNA was known to be a biological molecule at the time, but very little was known about its structure or function.</p>
      <p>Franklin began working as a research associate at King’s College in London in 1951, where she applied her expertise in X-ray crystallography to DNA fibres. Around 1953, she and her graduate student, Raymond Gosling, took a photograph that would irrevocably change the course of history, science, and medicine. Named “Photo 51,” the image clearly showed the helical structure of DNA.</p>
      <p>Most notable for her revolutionary photograph, Rosalind Franklin also made important contributions to the fields of coal research and virology. Her data allowed for James Watson and Francis Crick to better understand the structure of DNA molecules, and in fact, she came to the same conclusions as they did. Her colleague, Maurice Wilkins, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Watson and Crick, however, she had passed away at the time and was never recognized for her work.</p>
      <p>Franklin once said “science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated,” and she lived by that—she worked every day until her death.</p>

Her most important contribution involved an alternative wartime story that came from first-hand accounts of Chinese salvation and revolution.

      <h3>Former Prime Minister of Britain, Research Chemist, and Former British Conservative Party Leader</h3>
      <p>Margaret Thatcher was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was nicknamed the “Iron Lady” because of her uncompromising nature and leadership style. Thatcher was the longest serving prime minister of the 20th century, winning three consecutive terms. Born the daughter of a local businessman in 1925, she went on to study at Oxford where she earned a degree in chemistry, before later qualifying as a barrister and winning a seat in the House of Commons. She then became a part of the shadow cabinet, and was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. She served as leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, and eventually was elected prime minister after an economic and political turmoil led the conservative party to return to power.</p>
      <p>Margaret Thatcher’s policies and political views became known as Thatcherism. Thatcherism advocated for the privatization of nationalized industries and trade union legislation. Even though she was criticized by many for some of her controversial policies, the advancement she made for women is undeniable. Margaret Thatcher held a great deal of power in Britain, breaking countless barriers and proving that one’s sex does not define a leader.</p>

      <p>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in 1951. She was treated at Johns Hopkins University, where a few cells from her cervix were sampled and given to doctors without her consent. Doctors used Lack's cells in his cancer research in which they discovered that her cells were immortal, meaning they could be kept alive and grow indefinitely.</p>
      <p>For the past 70 years, Lacks’s cells have been used to make huge advancements in science and medicine. However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding her cells due to lack of consent and awareness leading to debates over what rights individuals have in regards to their genetic material and tissue.</p>
      <p>“Henrietta’s were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.” -  Rebecca Skloot, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></p>

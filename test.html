          <h2>Stephanie Pineda</h2>
          <h3>Contributor</h3>
          <p>Stephanie Pineda is a senior at California State University, Dominguez Hills.</p>
          <p>Stephanie believes that women's stories need to be heard by other women.We have lived long enough in a male-dominated society and have listened to their stories from their perspectives, while women’s voices were lost in the shuffle. Women, especially those of color or low socioeconomic status, have been denied proper recognition. Sharing their stories among other women allows for the possibility to dismantle the silence that has persisted for centuries. By telling these stories, we allow other women to become inspired and unleash their voices. Therefore, Stephanie is honored to be a part of iFeminist.</p>
          <p>Stephanie is also involved in the college leadership board for Girltelligence. Girltelligence is an app dedicated to women for support, advice, and establishes a community of sisterhood. Additionally, she volunteers for 7 Cups, where she provides support and listens to people who may be experiencing emotional distress. Lastly, she has volunteered and contributed to the student leadership board at St. Jude Hospital for three years, where she and her team oversee the membership department.</p>
          <p>One of Stephanie’s greatest passions is medicine and mental health and she hopes to one day be a woman in medicine! When she is not volunteering or taking part in my leadership, Stephanie loves to cook, garden, play with make-up, binge my favorite Netflix shows, and partake in photography.</p>
          <p>Stephanie’s research can be found on the Our Discoveries page!</p>

      <h3>First women to serve in both houses</h3>
      <p>Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to serve in both houses of the United States Congress, paving the way for women to hold influence in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Smith was also the first woman to represent Maine in the US government. Furthermore, she  passed the Women’s Armed Forces Integration Act, guaranteeing equal benefits to women who have served. She delivered the famous “Declaration of Conscience” speech as one of the first to criticize McCarthyism, an anti-communism campaign led by Senator Joseph McCarthy involving the persecution of anyone who was believed to be communist during the Cold War. Lastly, Smith served the 76th-92nd term in Congress, adding up to over 30 years of service.</p>
      <p>“The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.”- Margaret Chase Smith</p>

     <h3>“First woman to run the US government”</h3>
     <p>Edith Bolling Galt Wilson was the first woman to ever hold political power close to that of the President of the United States of America. Specifically, she took over the role of president during World War I and fearlessly led the nation through times of fear and uncertainty. She held great influence among the White House as well as the capital’s social elite, becoming a symbol of upholding the American homefront. The “secret president” also proved that the First Lady’s role extended beyond domestic virtues, transforming America’s perception of the First Lady to be a publicly prominent political position.</p>

      <h3>Lawyer, Advocate, <i>Maechee</i></h3>
      <p>Khunying Kanitha Wichiencharoen pioneered women's advocacy and protection in Thailand. From 1922 to 2002, she lived to protect and support women in several aspects: health, housing, education, and exploitation prevention. While fighting and advocating for laws amendments such as ensuring fair labor pay for both men and women, she opened shelters, clinics, and teaching facilities for women and children who needed the  help. Furthermore, to further the Women’s Rights Movement in Thailand, she founded the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW) to work towards her goal of equality and inclusivity. By protecting the women who suffered from discrimination and abuse, and working to prevent other women from becoming victims of such suffering, Wichiencharoen laid down the fundamental rights women in Thailand have today.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Dr. Suteera Thomson Vichitranonda, President of the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW), recognized Wichiencharoen, saying that her pathway was most precious and extraordinary and that in the 80 years of her life, others received many blessings from sharing ideas with her, working together, and learning from her.</p>
      <p>“I’m sad to say that in my country, we still have slavery even though it’s been more than 100 years since King Rama V abolished the practice.” - Khunying Wichiencharoen</p>

      <h3>Indian Politician</h3>
      <p>Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan was a significant figure in Indian politics for many decades, starting in the 1970s and following her retirement in 2022. Jagadeesan has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of many marginalized groups in India, from handloom workers to LGBTQ+ individuals. She started in state-level politics as a Minister of Handloom Textiles and eventually became an elected member of India’s Parliament. The politician spent a short period in jail due to her suspected involvement in the murder of a militant leader by the name of Padmanabha. However, she eventually appealed her case to the Supreme Court and was cleared of all charges. After working her way up the political ladder, she spent much of her time in Parliament raising awareness for the lack of female representation in Indian politics. Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan was and continues to be a proponent of the long-discussed reservation system in Parliament, where some seats in both houses would be reserved for women.</p>
      <p>“I am very keen to see major changes coming about in the lives of persons with autism…which come under the umbrella term developmental disabilities.” - Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan</p>

      <h3>First Reigning Queen of Korea and the Silla Kingdom</h3>
      <p>Queen Seondeok was an influential figure throughout the 600s, significantly modifying the Silla kingdom and further defying the entrenched gender barriers present in Korea at the time. As the first female ruler and Queen of Silla, she underwent numerous substantial challenges and experiences of confrontation from opposing sides that constantly questioned her ability to lead solely due to her gender. Nevertheless, her reign can be characterized through her resilience, passion, and innovation exhibited through her leadership, as she strengthened Silla’s connection with Tang China and appeased her people by building temples and Cheomseongdae, an acclaimed astronomical observatory still garnering popularity today. By going against the status quo of the time and exhibiting steadfast resistance to male authority deeming her as unqualified, Queen Seondeok stands as a prominent figure in Korean history today demonstrating that women are capable of anything. In 2009, a historical drama about her life called Queen Seondeok was aired.</p>

      <h3>American Espionage Agent</h3>
      <p>Virginia Hall was one of the first women to be an espionage agent. Although she lived in a time dominated by traditional values, where society taught her to believe that women should only focus on marriage, Hall was able to break the barriers that had been set for her. She chose to pursue higher education at one of the most prestigious women’s colleges, Barnard College, dreaming of becoming a diplomat.</p>
      <p>Even though Hall could no longer pursue that career due to the amputation of her left leg, she did not let that dictate her life. After impressing an SOE (Special Operations Executive) agent, she was hired to work for Britain’s World War II Espionage Organization. Through her wit and bravery, Hall provided the Allies valuable information, plotted safe areas, and completed other critical missions. Two years later, she joined the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), an American spy organization, where she provided equally important information and fulfilled other dangerous missions.</p>
      <p>She has received many awards from France, Britain, and the USA for her service. Virginia was the only woman to be given an award in World War II from the American government. After her eventful spy career, she and her husband worked office jobs at the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) for 15 years before they retired. Hall preferred to remain unrecognized throughout the rest of her life to stay safe and undisturbed.</p>

      <p>Payne never hesitated to call out injustices, and despite criticism from other Black journalists, she continued with her reports and made history on multiple occasions, being the first African-American woman to focus on international news coverage. Payne’s commentaries and written pieces continue to inspire today’s generation of journalists, and her bold personality made her an “unsung heroine.”</p>
      <p>“I stick to my firm, unshakeable belief that the Black press is an advocacy press, and that I, as a part of that press, can’t afford the luxury of being unbiased . . . when it come to issues that really affect my people, and I plead guilty, because I think that I am an instrument of change.” - Ethel Payne</p>

She was initially placed in a group of women to do clerical work, but once her code-breaking abilities were discovered, she became a staple of the team that broke the German Enigma. After the war, Clarke worked for the Government Communications Headquarters, researched coinage, and helped historians study the war-time code-breaking achievements of Bletchley Park. Due to the secrecy in the cryptanalytic field, the full extent of her achievements is unknown.</p>

      <p>In 1989, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was the first Hispanic woman to be elected to Congress. She was a member of Congress for almost three decades and represents a congressional district in South Florida. Ros-Lehtinen is from Havana, Cuba and has strongly voiced her opposition towards the Cuban government as she fights for the people’s freedom, democracy, and human rights. She made clear her opposition to dictatorships in Cuba, to the point where Fidel Castro gave her the nickname, “la Loba Feroz,” which translates to the “Ferocious She Wolf.”</p>
      <p>Ros-Lehtinen is a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community, which is apparent in her constant support for her transgender son, Rodrigo. In 2012, she was the first Republican to support marriage equality. She believes that it is important to accept your children for who they are and show unconditional love and support. Ros-Lehtinen has been a strong voice and congresswoman on Capitol Hill and has shown time and again that her work is not about politics or partisanship, but about people.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen decided to not seek re-election for Congress. Ros-Lehtinen was loved by her constituents, but retiring was a personal decision. While she is grateful to the United States and her constituents for giving her the opportunity to live a career of purpose and love, there are new adventures that await her in her personal life.</p>
      <p>“The issue of marriage equality, that was something the whole country had evolved on. Now it’s so accepted within our society, and I think it makes us a better county. If more members of our party listened to their hearts and acted on that, I think we would be better off.” -Ileana Ros-Lehtinen</p>

      <p>“Clearly it's not easy for women in modern society, no matter where they live.

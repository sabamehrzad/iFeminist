     <h3>African American Painter</h3>
     <p>Amy Sherald is a contemporary African American painter. Specifically, her works focus on the African American experience and how African Americans appear in American art. She paints her subjects with skin tones in gray scale to contrast the subject’s vibrant clothes and the pastel background; Sherald uses her art to urge her audience to look beyond just the skin tone of a person. As a result, she has continued to be an inspiration and an advocate for the African American community and the injustices they face.</p>
     <p>Sherald is most known for being the artist picked to paint former First Lady Michelle Obama’s official portrait. Sherald was also the first woman to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition for her 2014 painting <i>Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance)</i>. Furthermore, her work has been exhibited across many museums in the United States, including in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>

      <p>Carmen Amaya Amaya is known as the greatest flamenco dancer of all time.  Flamenco footwork was only reserved for men due to its speed and intensity until the 20th century due to Amaya’s tenacity. She was able to break the toxic masculinity that defined the dance form. As a result, she became the first woman to execute and openly perform the “men’s only” footwork, proving that women can transcend what is societally assigned to them.</p>
      <p>Amaya started dancing at a young age in her hometown in Barcelona, then at prestigious theaters in Spain, and eventually globally as more people recognized her talent and potential as a performer. Furthermore, she was cast in  Hollywood films and musical plays, such as <i>María de la O</i>. Rising to worldwide fame, Amaya toured across America and Europe, inspiring influential figures with her fierce and virtuosic style, such as Queen Elizabeth II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, and many more!</p>

      <h3>Mexican Painter</h3>
      <p>Frida Kahlo was a renowned Mexican painter remembered for her use of vibrant colors and eye-catching self-portraits. She extended her influence in Mexico and other parts of the world through her paintings and portfolio. Her works have continued to serve a prevalent role in the art world today and have impacted the lives of many through her use of social justice and feminist themes on the canvas.</p>
      <p>Before painting, Kahlo encountered many obstacles. From polio at the age of six to a near-fatal bus accident as a teenager, Kahlo used art as an opportunity to express her immense feelings through paintings. As the daughter of a German Jewish photographer, Kahlo would develop an artistic eye during her recovery from polio. Through her artistic experiences with her father and painting courses, the skill of painting traveled with Kahlo to the National Preparatory School in Mexico City. Soon after the bus accident, she painted her first artwork: <i>Self Portrait Wearing a Velvet Dress</i> (1926).</p>
      <p>200 paintings, sketches, and drawings later, Kahlo continues to be celebrated in Mexican and indigenous cultures around the globe.</p>

      <h3>Composer, Performer, and Pianist</h3>
      <p>Fanny Hensel was a talented musician and notable composer of the 19th century Romantic Era. She was skilled at playing the piano from a young age, and this proficiency translated into artistry when she entered the field of composition.  During her lifetime, she wrote nearly 500 compositions for various instrumentations, ranging from solo piano to string quartet to Lieder (vocalist with piano accompaniment). Four hundred sixty-seven of her works have been documented, though it is theorized that she may have written other pieces that have since been lost.</p>
      <p>Some of her most significant works include <i>Das Jahr</i>, a musical interpretation of the calendar year and masterpiece for piano, “Schwanenlied” (“Swan Song”), an intricately beautiful Lied, and Overture in C Major, her only discovered orchestral work.  Her overture has been performed by numerous prestigious symphonies around the world, such as Belfast’s Ulster Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Fanny Hensel’s compositions have also been featured by various musical institutions around the world for International Women’s Day.</p>
      <p>“And so we try to ornament and prettify our lives–that is the advantage of artists, that they can strew such beautifications about, for those nearby to take an interest in.” - Fanny Hensel</p>

      <h3>Italian Baroque Painter</h3>
      <p>In addition to her womanhood, Artemisia Gentileschi’s artistic expertise pushed barriers for canonical status in art and forever altered who could be deemed “a great artist.” As one of the few women of her time to achieve a successful career as an artist, Gentileschi resisted representations of women that catered to their (women’s) subjection by, instead, asserting their (women’s) multidimensionality.</p>
      <p>Despite achieving success and notoriety in her lifetime, Gentileschi’s artwork lost much of its relevance within the historical canon of western art, until it was given new life by feminist art historians. The impetus behind much of Gentileschi’s contemporary relevance is the amplified conversation of women’s oppression and sexual abuse of women, which are two themes found in Gentileschi’s life story and artwork. Her artwork remains a stimulus for conversations of women’s status in the world of art, as well as in the world at large.</p>

      <h3>Classical Era Musician and Composer</h3>
      <p>Maria Anna Mozart, older sister to Wolfgang Amedeus Mozart, was a prodigious musician. From a young age, she could play many instruments, such as the harpsichord and violin. Surrounded by a musical family, she went on a tour of Europe, where she and her brother Wolfgang performed for English audiences. She gained popularity for her natural talents and abilities, which shocked many people.</p>
      <p>Despite her fame, Maria Anna’s musical tours ended when she was eighteen, due to European expectations for women and reputation ideals. She was forced to settle down and marry, but continued independently pursuing her passion for music. She took on many students and even composed music. Though her compositions are lost, there is evidence that they were reputable, according to praise found in letters from Wolfgang. Even though societal norms held her back from her passions, she continued to make music throughout her life. Maria Anna’s unknown legacy begs to question how much music we have lost to societal gender norms.</p>

      <h2>Rosa Bonheur (1822-1899) <a href="arts.html"><button>Arts</button></a></h2>
      <h3>Renowned French Painter, LGBTQ Icon, and Member of the Legion of Honor</h3>
      <p>Rosa Bonheur was a French artist, born in 1822. As a painter and sculptor renowned for accuracy and detail in her works, Bonheur was the first female recipient of France’s highest honor: the Grand Cross.</p>
      <p><i>The Horse Fair</i> (1853), her masterpiece and most famous work, was acquired by Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1887. He later donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it can be found today. Beyond her artistic abilities, Bonheur was known for her trailblazing style of dress and romantic partners. She painted animals and farm or fair scenes, typically in dirty areas where lots of physical activity was required. In order for Bonheur to move freely without the burden of petticoats, the government allowed her to dress like a man, with a smock and trousers (otherwise forbidden to women). The juxtaposition of her femininity and her masculine style of dress has been cited as helping to shape the androgynous style of dress of the early 20th century. She also had two long-term female companions; in fact, she forced a change in the Napoleonic Code to legally transfer her estate to her romantic partner and fellow painter Anna Klumpke. Even after her death in 1899, she continued to serve as a role model for future female artists, LGBTQ+ luminaries, and feminists. </p>
      <p>“Why shouldn’t I be proud to be a woman? My father, that enthusiastic apostle of humanity, told me again and again that it was woman’s mission to improve the human race…To his doctrines I owe my great and glorious ambition for the sex to which I proudly belong, whose independence I’ll defend till my dying day. Besides, I’m convinced the future is ours.” - Rosa Bonheur</p>

      <h3>The “Mother of Modern Dance”</h3>
      <p>Isadora Duncan was one of the first dancers to successfully oppose ballet techniques and traditions in the West, thus credited with creating Modern Dance. She was an activist for free-love and feminism.</p>
      <p>“From all parts of her body shall shine radiant intelligence, bringing to the world the message of the thoughts and aspirations of thousands of women. She shall dance the freedom of woman,” Duncan said in a lecture, which has since been considered the manifesto of modern dance and women’s liberation.</p>

      <h3>Founder, Editor in Chief, and Head Software Developer</h3>
			<p>Saba is a junior at Syosset High School in Syosset, NY.</p>
			<p>She first started studying women in history when she was accepted as an intern at the New Historia under Women's Studies Professor Dr. Walker. She is excited to learn more about the women that paved the way for her! In her free time, she likes to celebrate her Iranian heritage with her Iranian teen group, go to the science laboratory, code, and watch old movies!</p>
      <p>Once she started studying Sedigheh Dolatabadi, she started to truly love, cherish, and appreciate her background because of Dolatabadi's amazing accomplishments. She wants everyone to feel empowered by their identity and feels as though studying Iranian women in history did that for her.</p>
      <p>Saba's work under Dr. Walker focused on Iranian journalist and philanthropist, Sedigheh Dolatabadi.  It is published here! Check it out on the Discoveries page.</p>

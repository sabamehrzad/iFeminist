			<p>She first started studying women in history when she was accepted as an intern at the New Historia under Women's Studies Professor Dr. Walker. She is excited to learn more about the women that paved the way for her! Once she started studying Sedigheh Dolatabadi, she started to truly love, cherish, and appreciate her background because of Dolatabadi's amazing accomplishments.

She is also the Founder and President of the Iranian American Society Teen Chapter to celebrate her culture and is a student teacher at her local Farsi school.</p>
      <p>Saba's work under Dr. Walker focused on Iranian journalist and philanthropist, Sedigheh Dolatabadi.  It is published here! Check it out on the Discoveries page.</p>

 <p>Samantha Cristoforetti was born in 1977 in Milan but was brought up in Malè, Trentino, Italy, where she spent most of her childhood. From a young age she and her brother, Jonathan Cristoforetti, were always supported by their parents, Antonella and Sergio Cristoforetti, to explore their passions and curiosity in science, technology, and humanities alike. She has always been an avid reader, nurturing her linguistic abilities since her time at the Liceo Scientifico in Trento, Italy. At 18, while still in high school, she was immersed in the English-speaking world when she enrolled in an American foreign exchange program and attended Space Camp in the States, ultimately becoming fluent in English, German, French, Russian, and even a little Chinese. After finishing high school in Trento, she went on to graduate with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on aerospace propulsion and lightweight structures from the Technische Universität Munich. When the Italian Air Force opened applications to women, Cristoforetti was one of the first to apply in 2001. She was accepted as an official candidate for the Air Force Academy and served as section leader for four years. There, she was awarded the Sword of Honor for best academic achievement and to this day remains a captain of the Force.</p>
 <p>As part of her studies, she spent four months at the prestigious French engineering school Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France, working on an experimental aerodynamics project. Then, she spent ten months in Moscow, Russia, at the Mendeleev University of Chemical Technologies, writing her thesis on solid propellants in rockets. She also earned a bachelor’s scientific degree in aeronautics from the Federico II University of Naples, Italy, just two years after in 2005. Upon graduating, she joined the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training program at Sheppard Air Force Base in the United States, where she earned her fighter pilot wings in 2006.</p>
 <p>While she prefers to keep her professional and personal life separate, when not traveling for work, Cristoforetti lives with her husband, Lionel Ferra, a French astronaut instructor, and their two children Kelsi Amel and Dorian Lev near ESA’s (European Space Association) Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. By 2007, Cristoforetti completed the "Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals" training fundamentals of combat through the United States Air Force, an “eight-week course designed to transform newly graduated pilots selected to fly fighters into fighter wingmen.” Not to mention, between 2006 and 2007, Cristoforetti also earned the title of Captain in the Italian Air Force through which she has amassed over 500 flight hours on six types of military aircrafts.</p>
 <p>Once Cristoforetti returned to Italy around 2007 and 2008, she was deployed to the 51st Bomber Wing in Istrana (located in the Italian region of Veneto) with the mission of flying the AM-X ground attack fighter and serving in the Planning and Operations section of the institution. In 2008, she joined the 101 Squadrone, 32 Stormo Bomber team based in Foggia, Italy, where she underwent operational training for the AM-X attack aircraft, of which she ultimately became an experienced pilot and operator.</p>

 <p>In May of 2009, she was one of six chosen from 8000 European applicants to join the ESA astronaut corp and she accordingly began her ESA training in September of the same year, finishing it in November 2010. In July 2012, she was assigned to a mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS), during which she broke records for females, Italians, and astronauts alike. This was the eighth long-duration mission for an ESA astronaut and the second completely led by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).</p>
 <p>Expedition 42/42 came to be called “Futura” and lasted about 6 months, for which she left for Kazakhstan in November 2014 and returned in May 2015. The predominant significance behind this space mission was that Cristoforetti broke the record for the longest continuous aeronautical journey by a female of any nationality, spending 199 days and 16 hours outside of our atmosphere. A fun fact for many, on May 3, 2015, Cristoforetti drank the first espresso in microgravity conditions, made with her very own coffee machine brought from Earth.</p>
 <p>Following her post-flight tasks, Cristoforetti served as a technical and management worker at the European Astronaut Centre, where she worked on engineering evaluation boards for future exploration projects. She directed the Spaceship EAC effort for several years, a student-centered team focusing on the scientific hurdles of future Moon missions. She subsequently worked as ESA's crew representative in the Gateway project to create a transit base orbiting the Moon for two years, contributing knowledge on crew systems and livability elements for the ESA-provided I-Hab module.</p>
 <p>She participated in a maritime survival drill in the Yellow Sea in 2017, alongside fellow ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, hosted by the Astronaut Center of China. Cristoforetti was the commander of NASA's 23rd Extreme Environment Expedition Operations (NEEMO23) mission during a ten-day stay in the world's only underwater research facility, Aquarius, in 2019.</p>

 <p>However, her unwavering love for outer space never faded. On April 27, 2022, she returned to the International Space Station for her second mission, Minerva, launching in a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule named Freedom alongside her fellow NASA colleagues and crewmates.</p>
 <p>This mission not only marked another significant achievement in her illustrious career but also highlighted her ongoing commitment to advancing scientific research and exploration.</p>
 <p>Through her remarkable story, Cristoforetti not only paves the way for future female astronauts but also serves as a powerful role model for women in STEM fields. As one of the first Black women selected for a long-duration mission, Jessica Watkins has cited Cristoforetti's achievements as motivation to break barriers in the aerospace industry.</p>
 <p>As Cristoforetti continues to inspire future generations of explorers, her journey serves as a powerful reminder that the pursuit of knowledge and adventure knows no bounds as her every mission brings us closer to understanding the universe and our place within it.</p>

<h4 class="WC">Why Did I Choose to Research Samantha Cristoforetti?</h4>
<p>When I was younger, my dreams of becoming an astronaut felt limitless, much like those of countless other children. However, as I grew older, the risks of space travel began to weigh on me. The Challenger disaster, which occurred just 73 seconds after launch, made me question whether pursuing such a path was worth the potential dangers. Yet, while many abandon their dreams, some persevere and become legends. As an Italian, Samantha Cristoforetti stands as a powerful symbol of inspiration for me. Her achievements remind me to hold onto my aspirations, no matter how daunting they may seem. Her journey has taught me that the path to greatness is often fraught with challenges, but those who dare to persevere can achieve the extraordinary. Knowing that someone from my homeland has reached such incredible heights motivates me to pursue my goals and dreams, proving that with dedication and resilience, anything is possible.</p>

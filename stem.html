      <p>Dr. Alma Dea Morani, the first woman in the United States to ever pursue a career in plastic surgery, showcased extreme grit and passion within her lifetime. She persevered to build a name for herself, despite the numerous obstacles that assuming a career in a male-dominated field brought forth. The immense difficulty to receive proper training as a woman in this specialty often steered many away, fearful of receiving prejudice or being belittled by their male counterparts. Yet, Morani never abandoned her desire and instead utilized the restrictions set on her as fuel to become a talented plastic surgeon.</p>

      <h3>Chemist and X-Ray Crystallographer</h3>
      <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist who earned her Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Cambridge University. She applied her knowledge of physical chemistry and crystallography to research deciphering the structure of DNA. DNA was known to be a biological molecule at the time, but very little was known about its structure or function.</p>
      <p>Franklin began working as a research associate at King’s College in London in 1951, where she applied her expertise in X-ray crystallography to DNA fibres. Around 1953, she and her graduate student, Raymond Gosling, took a photograph that would irrevocably change the course of history, science, and medicine. Named “Photo 51,” the image clearly showed the helical structure of DNA.</p>
      <p>Most notable for her revolutionary photograph, Rosalind Franklin also made important contributions to the fields of coal research and virology. Her data allowed for James Watson and Francis Crick to better understand the structure of DNA molecules, and in fact, she came to the same conclusions as they did. Her colleague, Maurice Wilkins, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Watson and Crick, however, she had passed away at the time and was never recognized for her work.</p>
      <p>Franklin once said “science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated,” and she lived by that—she worked every day until her death.</p>

      <h3>Tobacco Farmer and Medical Pioneer</h3>
      <p>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer in 1951. She was treated at Johns Hopkins University, where a few cells from her cervix were sampled and given to doctors without her consent. Doctors used Lack's cells in his cancer research in which they discovered that her cells were immortal, meaning they could be kept alive and grow indefinitely.</p>
      <p>For the past 70 years, Lacks’s cells have been used to make huge advancements in science and medicine. However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding her cells due to lack of consent and awareness leading to debates over what rights individuals have in regards to their genetic material and tissue.</p>
      <p>“Henrietta’s were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.” -  Rebecca Skloot, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></p>
